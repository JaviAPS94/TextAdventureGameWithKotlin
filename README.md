# Text Adventure with Kotlin

Its a Text Adventure! The goal is to make it home without dying. There are numerous different things you can do to make your rigorous journey more interesting such as fishing rather than hunting or crafting a walking stick so you can make the trip faster and much much more! Along your journey you may also stumble across a village where you can either ransack it or trade with the villagers.
